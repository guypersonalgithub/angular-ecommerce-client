# This is the client part of a E-commerce Angular project.

The admin only parts have been purposely removed due to Heroku's free tierlist's limitations. They had admin-related functions that allow admins to upload, edit and remove products, alongside a dedicated admin only panel with specific authentications.
The project is being hosted [here](https://adoring-mayer-5b9576.netlify.app/).
The server is hosted on Heroku's free tier, and because of that the first connection to the server might be slow.
